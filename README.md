> An electron-vue project

## Development Environment Setup
### Prerequisites
#### For macOS
1. Have `Node.js` installed in your machine. 
   If not, follow the instruction [here](https://dyclassroom.com/howto-mac/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew) to install. 
   
2. Have `yarn` installed in your machine. 
   If not, once you meet the first prerequisite, follow the instruction [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) to install.
   
#### For Windows
1. Install `chocolatey` package manager if you don't have one. 
2. Install `Node.js` via `chocolatey`
3. Install `yarn` via `chocolatey`

### IDE Setup
Webstorm (by Jetbrains) is the recommended IDE for this project. Visual Studio Code is also a great tool if you are familiar 
with it. If you want to use Webstorm, it will set up almost everything for you. If you would like to go ahead with VSCode, 
make sure you have `Vetur` extension installed for `Vue` support. 

### Repository Setup
1. ~~Fork this repository to your own github by clicking on the fork button on the top-right corner on the home page~~

2. Clone the repository that is in your own github to your local machine.


### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
yarn run dev

# build electron application for production
yarn run build

# run unit tests
yarn test

# lint all JS/Vue component files in `src/`
yarn run lint

```

## Workflow
1. Update the local main branch
2. Create a new feature branch with a meaningful name
3. Write code!
4. Commit changes
5. Write more code and commit if necessary
6. Push your local branch onto github
7. Make a pull request
8. After the pull request get reviewed, squash and merge. 

Workflow practice. Write your name here.
